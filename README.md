# CS149 Parallel Computing

This repo contains all the learning materials for the Stanford CS149 course : Parallel Computing.

The professor [Kayvon Fatahalian](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kayvonf) used to teach the same course in CMU (called 15-418). So you can  go to the CMU 15-418's [official website](http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/lectures) to watch the course videos.

The CS149's website is [here](http://cs149.stanford.edu/fall20/) which has links to github repo of the programming assignments.

## Course Resources

### Introduction

You can go to the course website to see the syllabus. The 15-418 version is more comprehensive and talks many topics which is not included in the CS149 version. 

The goal of this course is to provide a deep understanding of the fundamental principles and engineering trade-offs involved in designing modern parallel computing systems as well as to teach parallel programming techniques necessary to effectively utilize these machines. Because writing good parallel programs requires an understanding of key machine performance characteristics, this course will cover both parallel hardware and software design.

### Written Assignments

I only find the 2020 spring written assignments with solution. You can find it in the [exercises](./exercieses) folder.

### Programming Assignments

There are five programming assignments in total. You can find my implementaion in the following links.

[Assignment 1: Analyzing Parallel Program Performance on a Quad-Core CPU](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/asst1)

[Assignment 2: Scheduling Task Graphs](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/asst2)

[Assignment 3: A Simple Renderer in CUDA](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/asst3)

[Assignment 4: Big Graph Processing in OpenMP](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/asst4)

### Exams

There are two exams in total. You can find them with solution in the [exams](./exams) folder.
