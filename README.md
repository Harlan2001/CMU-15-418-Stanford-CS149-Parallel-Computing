# CS149 Parallel Computing

Professor Kayvon Fatahalian previously taught the course 15-418 at CMU and later taught the similar course CS149 when he became an assistant professor at Stanford.Overall, however, 15-418 contains more extensive course content and has course replays, while CS149 has more fashion programming assignments.I personally watched the course video for 15-418 but completed the CS149 assignment.

This course will give you an in-depth understanding of the design principles and trade-offs of modern parallel computing architectures, and learn how to leverage hardware resources and software programming frameworks (such as CUDA, MPI, OpenMP, etc.) to write high-performance parallel programs.Due to the complexity of parallel computing architecture, this course will cover a lot of advanced architecture and network communication content, which is quite basic and core.At the same time, the five programming assignments will develop students' understanding and application of upper level abstractions from the software level, which will allow you to analyze bottlenecks in parallel programs, write multithreaded synchronization code, learn CUDA programming, OpenMP programming, and the Spark framework, which has been popular recently.The real sense of theory and practice perfectly together.
